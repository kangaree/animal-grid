# Villager Crossing

Animal Crossing: New Horizons features three themes: family, friendship and community. The reason I wanted to investigate them was a result of being so lonely in NYC. I was living on the island of Manhattan when the pandemic happened and I couldn't visit my family and friends. In doing so, I realized that being close to them - being able to spend time with them, talk to them, play with them - was such a great, important thing. I wondered for a long time if there would be a way to recreate that feeling, and that was the impetus behind making this project for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

This is a project built for social purposes only.
